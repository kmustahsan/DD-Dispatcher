# DD Dispatcher
An iOS application to streamline the DD'ing proccess of all college fraternities and sororities. 


## Introduction
The current DD'ing (designated driving) system implemented at most college fraternities and sororities is done on paper! 
When the party is live, to get a DD to safely drive you home, you have to contact the DD organizer for the night, 
tell them your destination, and whenever an avaliable DD arrives, they will pass on the ride request to the DD via paper. 
As you can imagine, for large parties this becomes a problem for everyone involved. 
The organizer must manage all ride request from the party-goers by writing their name, contact information, and destination. 
The DD needs to retrieve a ride request, find the rider, safely get the rider to their destination, and most importantly 
manage ride requests coming from text while safely driving.  

To resolve these issues, we have created DD Dispatcher!
